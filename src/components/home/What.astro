        <strong>System Agnostic</strong>
          Rebound's toolbox is not bound to a particular system. Whether it's Cloud, On-Premise or "It's complicated", Rebound follows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metrics Driven</strong>
        With knowledge comes wisdom. Rebound has a mission to turn resilience from a perceived cost to a must have strategic asset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scale With You</strong>
        Grow at your own pace. Rebound adapts to your journeyâ€”from early development to enterprise operations.
